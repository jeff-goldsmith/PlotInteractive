PlotInteractive
===============

This repository contains code for interactive plots of functional data analyses. The primary function is `plot_interactive`, which calls other functions depending on the class of the object. (So far, the only supported class is "fpca" for functional principal components analyses).

These functions have been incorporated in the the refund package; any updates will be made there.
